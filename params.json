{"name":"Gem-check-sources","body":"## gem-check-sources\r\n\r\n**gem-check-sources** keeps your local list of gem sources in sync and removes any gem servers that might be unavailable.\r\n\r\n### Why?\r\n\r\nImagine you work at a company that hosts its own gem server within the corporate network.  At work you need to install and update gems hosted on the corporate\r\nserver, but when you take your laptop home and try to work on a side project all your remote gem commands fail.  \r\n\r\nSo, you end up typing 'gem sources -a' and 'gem sources -r' a lot.\r\n\r\ngem-check-sources solves this problem by maintaining two list of gem servers (active and inactive).  If a server is unavailable it gets put on the inactive list and removed from your gem sources.  It will get added back when it becomes available again.\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n\r\n  gem install gem-check-sources\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\n\r\n  gem check_sources\r\n\r\nThat's it.  If something is inactive and you want to add it back just run the command again.\r\n\r\n### Links\r\n\r\n* Issue tracking: http://github.com/britt/gem-check-sources/issues\r\n\r\n### Note on Patches/Pull Requests\r\n \r\n* Fork the project.\r\n* Make your feature addition or bug fix.\r\n* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a\r\n  future version unintentionally.\r\n* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.\r\n  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)\r\n* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.\r\n\r\n### Copyright\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2009 Britt Crawford.
